# **Crypto Piggy Bank**

## **1. Project Title**

Crypto Piggy Bank â€“ A Simple STX Lock & Release Contract

## **2. Project Description**

The Crypto Piggy Bank is a Clarity smart contract that allows users to deposit STX tokens and lock them until a specified block height. Once the blockchain reaches that block height, users can withdraw their funds. This creates a simple savings mechanism on the Stacks blockchain without any third-party involvement.

## **3. Project Vision**

The vision of the Crypto Piggy Bank is to promote disciplined saving in the blockchain space by enabling users to lock funds for a fixed period. This ensures financial planning, prevents impulsive spending, and encourages holding strategies for crypto assets.

## **4. Future Scope**

* Add support for multiple deposits per user.
* Implement interest or rewards for locked funds.
* Allow deposits in fungible tokens, not just STX.
* Add penalty fees for early withdrawals.
* Integrate with DeFi lending platforms to utilize locked funds for yield.
